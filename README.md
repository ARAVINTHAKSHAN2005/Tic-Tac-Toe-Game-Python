# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Python
#### Different version of the Tic Tac Toe Game written in Python and GUI made using Tkinter

#### There are three different version of the Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
 1. TicTacToeKeyBoardVersion.py 
    * This has no GUI as is played using the NumPad on your keyboard where each number corresponds to a location on the Tic-Tac-Toe Board 
 2. MainCodeGui.py
    * This version has a GUI and asks the user to click a button to start the game and enter whether Player 1 wishes to be X or O 
    * Then randomly picks which user gets to go first using the random library 
    * After this the game continues as usual 
 3. NewSimpleVersion.py
    * This version of the game is much more user friendly and starting the game is as easy as choosing whether Player 1 wants to be X, Yes or No from the message box that opens up 
    
The Code uses Simple Python Loops, Conditional Statements and Libraries to make the game functional.
